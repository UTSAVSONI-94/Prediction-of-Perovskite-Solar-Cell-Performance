Prediction of Perovskite Solar Cell Performance
Overview
This repository presents a machine learning approach for predicting the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Perovskite solar cells are gaining significant attention due to their high power conversion efficiencies and low-cost fabrication. Accurate performance prediction assists researchers and engineers in accelerating the design and optimization of efficient PSC devices by screening material compositions and device configurations before experimental synthesis.​

Problem Statement
The optical and electrical performance of PSCs depends on multiple factors, including material composition, device architecture, fabrication processes, and operating conditions. Traditional experimental approaches for optimization are time-consuming, resource-intensive, and require domain expertise. This project utilizes tabular device and material data with machine learning regression techniques to predict solar cell properties, aiming to facilitate rapid virtual screening and the design of next-generation photovoltaic materials.​

Features
Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis of perovskite solar cell datasets

Implementation of supervised machine learning models (e.g., linear regression, random forest, XGBoost) for predicting key performance metrics like:

Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE)

Open-circuit voltage (Voc)

Short-circuit current density (Jsc)

Fill factor (FF)

Evaluation and comparison of model performance via cross-validation and error metrics

Analysis of feature importances to interpret which material/device parameters most strongly influence PSC performance.​
